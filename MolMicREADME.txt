                          ##==README for MolMic.py==##

                           ##==Requirements==##
            
# MolMic.py requires python3.7 to be installed in order to run. 
# In addition to standard library, MolMic.py uses scripts from RDKit and numpy 
# RDKit and numpy can be downloaded from rdkit.org and numpy.org

                              ##==How to use==##
                              
==Run MolMic from command line== 
# Type: python <space> MolMic.py <space> <query.sdf> <space> <reference.sdf> 
# For example: python MolMic.py rfp.sdf lfp.sdf
# When prompted for output file, enter an available output filename
# Query has to be sanitised before fragmentation. Enter a valid filename 
# to store sanitised query when prompted 
# MolMic will start the analysis. Results will be written to output.dat file

                          ##==Program desciption==##
            
# MolMic computes molecular similarity between a query molecule and multiple reference molecules 
# Results are the top 4 ranked-matches from reference molecules 
# 3 types of matches are computed: Size match, Fragment match, and Atom match
# Size match compares query and ref molecule sizes, assuming molecule is cuboid
# Fragment match compares number of similar fragments between query and ref
# Fragments are generated by breaking bonds between molecule subregions
# Atom match compares number of C, N, and O atoms between query and ref

                          ##== Output file ==##
                          
# Output file contains molecule name, weighted centre of gravity, and molecule size
# Ranked-matches are at the very end of output file
